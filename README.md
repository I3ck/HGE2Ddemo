HGE2Ddemo
=========

Early freeze of a game I am currently working on.
Meant to be used as an example on how to use [HGE2D](https://github.com/I3ck/HGE2D).  


I'll try to keep it compatible with the latest version of HGE2D.
Feel free to contribute updates to keep it compatible, but please don't  
try to improve the game itself. (except if it in any way makes this a better example)
